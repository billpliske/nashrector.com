# Website for NashRector.com

Website for grandson's first birthday party.

A few details:

-   Built in React, served by Netlify.
-   Video player used: https://github.com/CookPete/react-player
-   Didn't feel like fussing with a desktop version (time factor), so I just limited the width to 600px.
-   Digging the newer "inline" feature that doesn't force iPhones to play video fullscreen. That way, I was able to make it look like the videos were playing on the computer screens.
