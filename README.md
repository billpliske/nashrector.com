# Website for NashRector.com

Website for grandson's first birthday party.

A few details:

-   Built in React, served by Netlify.
-   Video player used: https://github.com/CookPete/react-player
-   Didn't feel like fussing with a desktop version (time factor), so I just limited the width to 600px.
-   Digging the newer "inline" feature that doesn't force iPhones to play video fullscreen. That way, I was able to make it look like the videos were playing on the computer screens.

Video process:
- Use QuickTime Player
- New Screen Recording
- Choose Soundflower 2 on the record drop down.
- Go to System settings, and make sound OUTPUT Soudflower 2.
- Click record, highlight video area, and play.
- Once done, stop video, and just hit Save from QuickTime
- Open in iMovie to edit (fade in/out) - save as File (smallest size)
- Open that file in Handbrake
- Use very fast, 720 setting for family sites.
- Save to cloudinary
